32,234,image,when we print the seamcarve photo function from the processing we get a correctly carved photo however when we try to print that same image in our driver the image is not carved please help thank you
23,234,image,im pretty sure i dont go past the end of argv because i check for argc before accessing the members but it seems like my program is operating like argc is always 5 it works fine when a height argument is passed in so argc 5 but not when argc 4 any ideas as to what might be going wrong would be greatly appreciated
67,67,image,when i try something like this const int size imagewidthsomeimg int arr3size i get the error variable length arrays are a c99 feature werrorwvlaextension how do i make an array and set its size
45,45,image,i have no idea how to get the arguments from the compiler as inputs please help
34,34,image,when i click on the button it does nothing need to change code that is submitted really quick cant do it because of this
34,34,image,why the submission is always queued in autograder now
34,34,image,error ‘ strcmp ’ was not declared in this scope i have the library included as well why wont this code compile on caen but it compiles on my mac via terminal and also in xcode
34,34,image,i do not have a button to remove my submission and put in my new one it has been queued for a long while now help
34,34,image,im getting a valgrind error with a massive amount of invalid read and writes mostly associated with matrixinit and the assignment of height and width to the matrix values example 1125000 errors in context 167 of 174 46365 invalid read of size 8 46365 at 0x4c2e25e memcpyglibc214 in usrlib64valgrindvgpreloadmemcheckamd64linuxso 46365 by 0x404a3c imagegetpixelimage const int int imagecpp166 46365 by 0x40526a computeenergymatriximage const matrix processingcpp108 46365 by 0x401f85 testallstdstring int int processingtestscpp60 46365 by 0x401d2f main processingtestscpp34 46365 address 0xffee17b50 is on thread 1s stack 46365 in frame 3 created by testallstdstring int int processingtestscpp48 46365 46365 46365 1218452 errors in context 168 of 174 46365 invalid read of size 8 46365 at 0x4c2e25e memcpyglibc214 in usrlib64valgrindvgpreloadmemcheckamd64linuxso 46365 by 0x404a17 imagegetpixelimage const int int imagecpp165 46365 by 0x40526a computeenergymatriximage const matrix processingcpp108 46365 by 0x401f85 testallstdstring int int processingtestscpp60 46365 by 0x401d2f main processingtestscpp34 46365 address 0xffed23908 is on thread 1s stack 46365 in frame 3 created by testallstdstring int int processingtestscpp48 46365 46365 46365 1499904 errors in context 169 of 174 46365 invalid write of size 8 46365 at 0x4c2e253 memcpyglibc214 in usrlib64valgrindvgpreloadmemcheckamd64linuxso 46365 by 0x404a61 imagegetpixelimage const int int imagecpp167 46365 by 0x40526a computeenergymatriximage const matrix processingcpp108 46365 by 0x401f85 testallstdstring int int processingtestscpp60 46365 by 0x401d2f main processingtestscpp34 46365 address 0xffea46940 is on thread 1s stack 46365 in frame 1 created by imagegetpixelimage const int int imagecpp160 46365 46365 46365 1500012 errors in context 170 of 174 46365 invalid write of size 8 46365 at 0x4c2e253 memcpyglibc214 in usrlib64valgrindvgpreloadmemcheckamd64linuxso 46365 by 0x404a3c imagegetpixelimage const int int imagecpp166 46365 by 0x40526a computeenergymatriximage const matrix processingcpp108 46365 by 0x401f85 testallstdstring int int processingtestscpp60 46365 by 0x401d2f main processingtestscpp34 46365 address 0xffe9526f0 is on thread 1s stack 46365 in frame 1 created by imagegetpixelimage const int int imagecpp160
34,34,image,for anyone having issues passing this test check that your dogoutppm is seam carving to be 4x5 i kept failing this test as well and realized i miswrote some code and it was outputting a 5x4 image instead of 4x5 make sure the single input is being inputted to width and not height as small and silly as this may sound it may be the difference between a 67 and 77
34,34,image,im getting a 01 on imagepublictest and im not sure why are my tests just not good enough error
34,34,image,so im running the project solely on caen so i dont think its a problem with my stack size but when i try and run processingtestscpp it compiles fine but throws us a segmentation fault so i used gdb to debug and it successfully calls testallprefixdog sizes0x7fffffffe1d0 numsizes1 in main but when it tries to call testrotate inside testall its giving my partner and i a segmentation fault error on the actual line static void testrotateconst image img string prefix the exact error message is testrotateimgerror reading variable cannot access memory at address 0x7fffff57ff78 prefixerror reading variable cannot access memory at address 0x7fffff57ff70 were just confused because it never even calls any of the functions we made and if it does any insight to which one it might be would be awesome thanks
34,34,image,my code has worked 100 when i have tested it on my machine and on caen the only thing im missing on the autograder is this test heres what its saying resizedog4x5public return code incorrect score for resizedog4x5public total 01 not much to go off of any advice on what might be the problem or where to look in my code that will affect this test and no other
34,34,image,i finished my resize but i am still running into problems with the autograder my output file is correct when tested with dog 4x5 but im getting 00 on the autograder anyone have any ideas on what could be going wrong or anything i could be missing thank you very much
34,34,image,im debating with a friend both of our code works but one of us thinks resize should be atoi and the other things stoi atoi if command line arguments are cstrings and stoi if they are strings which is better for resize and why are both working thanks saul
34,34,image,so i initialized the image with the given input i checked to see if the output input files can open and checked all of the other mentioned errors after that i used the seam algorithm to adjust the image to the new size what else is there left to do i saw others mentioning printing to an outputfile but im not seeing anything in the specs about that
